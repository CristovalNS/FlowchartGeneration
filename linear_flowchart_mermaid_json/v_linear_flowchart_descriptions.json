The flow starts at the \"Start\" node and proceeds through a series of steps, each represented by a node. Each step involves a process or I/O operation, which is indicated by the text within the node. The flow then returns to the \"Start\" node, indicating a loop or a series of repeating steps. Finally, the flow ends at the \"End\" node.",
