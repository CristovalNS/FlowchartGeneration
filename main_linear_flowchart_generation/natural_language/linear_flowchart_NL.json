        "description": "This flowchart represents a structured linear process that begins with a Start node and progresses through a sequence of process steps and input/output (I/O) operations before reaching the End node. The flow follows a left-to-right (LR) direction, indicating a structured workflow. The process starts at the Start node and moves to Process 1, which represents the first step in the workflow. The output from this step leads to Process 2, continuing the sequence. After Process 2, the flow encounters an I/O operation, labeled 'I/O 3,' indicating an interaction where data is received or sent. Following the I/O operation, the workflow proceeds to Process 4, which is another action or transformation step. From there, another I/O operation, labeled 'I/O 5,' occurs, likely handling additional data exchanges. After the second I/O operation, the flow moves to Process 6 and then transitions to Process 7, which is the final processing step. Finally, the flowchart concludes at the End node, marking the completion of the process. This flowchart is designed to illustrate a structured sequence of steps where processes alternate with I/O operations, ensuring data is handled at key points before reaching the final stage.",
